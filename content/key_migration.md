Hey

I'm at 33c3 at the moment, and I was inspired to make a new GPG key, since my
old one is from 2012 (and was revoked by me almost 6 months ago), and back
then I didn't do it the way I'd like to now

Anyways, so I made a new key, **0x58dd226b3ea71dc7**, which is both on
[pgp.mit.edu](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x58DD226B3EA71DC7)
and [here](https://pub.wxcafe.net/wxcafe.asc). Of course, in these
kind of situations you're supposed to publish a message signed with both keys.
However, since I revoked the old one without thinking about this a few months
ago, it would be basically meaningless. Moreover, basically all the signatures
on that old key were from keys that expired since then, so it's not like that
old key was very trustable either.

Anyways, I'm signing this with the new key, and I'm also including [this
link](https://twitter.com/Wxcafe/status/814300732849553408) to a tweet I made,
which contains the key ID.

This should suffice to link this key to my identity, and I hope to gather some
signatures at 33c3 too ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’¯ðŸš€

Thanks for your understanding

I'm also linking this message [over
here](https://pub.wxcafe.net/key_migration.asc) so that even if you can't verify
this by copy/pasting from the webpage you can still get the message unmodified
and verify it.

Thank you
