Source code for my [blog][]
===========================

So this is the source code for my blog.
More exactly, this is the configuration files and the theme I've used and
modified to put this blog online.

This repository will also contain the markdown "source" for the articles, and of
course the output folder.

So here goes. Not sure why anyone would be interested, but still.
